# Design_Project

## Introduction
Most of the two-wheeler riders face problems during rainy season. Even though they use raincoats there are still problems in using it, and those who use rain covers also faces problems. So in this project we are going to identify those problems and come up with a suitable solution for them.

## PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION
